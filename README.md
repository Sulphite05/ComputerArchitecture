# ComputerFromScratch

## Overview

This repository contains all the tasks, projects, and assignments completed as part of the **Nand2Tetris** course. The course, also known as "From Nand to Tetris," is a hands-on journey through the fundamentals of computer systems, starting from basic logic gates and building up to a fully functional computer capable of running Tetris.

The repository is organized to reflect the structure of the course, with each chapter or project having its own dedicated directory. This README provides an overview of the repository's structure and how to navigate it.
